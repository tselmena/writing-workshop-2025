# Instructions

Divide your team in 2 sub-teams: sub-team 1 will work on data
collection/variables, sub-team 2 on analytic methods.

Dedicate 10 minutes to Part 1 and 5 minutes to Part 2.

## Part 1

### Sub-team 1 - Data collection and variables

1.  What is one aspect of data collection or variable creation, in your
    project, that you think will be particularly important to describe?
    Why?

-   Describe A4 study

-   Why we picked only placebo

-   Data engineering

-   Time interval (+- 12 weeks), motivation behind that

-   Talk about 14 week prior to screening and why that was motivated

-   How we came up with the W48 data frame with all delta scores
    -converting to z scores, motivation

YOUR ANSWER HERE

2.  Can you think of a visualization that could support the discussion
    of this aspect in your methodology section? Describe it

YOUR ANSWER HERE

[Examples: diagram illustrating a complex sampling scheme; diagram
illustrating the stages of the study; diagram illustrating how several
variables were combined into one; etc.]

### Sub-team 2 - Analytic methods

Focus on your main statistical analysis.

-   Write down a formula to explain the main analysis you currently plan
    to do

Univariate equation

$$ logit(1_{CDRGlobal_{240} > 0.5}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \Delta SCORE_{48} $$

-   How could you motivate the chosen model?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

-   What quantities (parameters) in this model are key to answer your
    research question? How should they be interpreted?

## Part 2

1.  Sub-team 1: show your work to Sub-team 2. Sub-team 2, comment:

-   Do you agree about the choice of sub-team 1?

-   How could you all improve the proposed visualization?

2.  Sub-team 2: show your work to Sub-team 1. Sub-team 1, comment:

-   Is there any difference between the model that was written down and
    the model you had in mind?

-   How could you all improve the motivation for the model and the
    interpretation?
